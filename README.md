## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any
  additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
  - [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
  - [React Helmet Async](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet-async)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Linting & Code Formatting
  - [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)
- Hosting
  - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

### My Objective

I practiced this solution using TypeScript since I'm currently still learning it and want to try
using it in this projects.

### What I Learned

This side project was quite challenging for me. However, through this experience, I've gained a solid understanding of how to implement the calculator logic and handle various edge cases effectively. This project has significantly improved my problem-solving skills and my ability to apply TypeScript in practical scenarios.

### Continued Development

I will keep on improving my understanding of advanced TypeScript concepts, such as generics and
decorators. I will also focus on learning how to test React applications using libraries like Jest.

For these projects, I'm planning to add sound effects/noise. For example, when I click a button, it
will produce a click sound.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/index.php) - This resource helped me understand
  specific CSS properties and their usage. I found the pattern and explanations very clear and
  useful, and I will continue to use this reference in the future.
- [TypeScript CheatSheet](https://www.typescriptlang.org/cheatsheets/) - This resource helped me
  understand TypeScript better, particularly with type annotations and interface usage.

## Getting Started

| Description                       | Command        |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| To install dependencies           | `pnpm install` |
| To start the development server   | `pnpm dev`     |
| To build your project             | `pnpm build`   |
| To lint your code                 | `pnpm lint`    |
| To preview your built project     | `pnpm preview` |
| To format your code with Prettier | `pnpm format`  |

### Note: If you encounter an error, please follow these steps:

1. Delete `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `node_modules`.
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Then

```bash
pnpm dev
```

4. Optionally, you can also clean up your pnpm store for better performance

```bash
pnpm store prune
```
